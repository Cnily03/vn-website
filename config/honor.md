# Honor

H2 after `##` is the title. Text under the title is the content of the section.

It's available to use icons in the directory `src/icons/`. Put the SVG filename (without extension) between `:` to use the icon. For example, `:github:`.

Because the H2 section isn't started yet, The text above won't be rendered in the HTML.
